### Hi, I’m Tilly 👋❤️ Graphic & Brand Identity Designer | Budding Full-Stack Software Engineer

I’m a creative soul with a passion for turning ideas into visuals that speak. I help brands — especially startups and small businesses — tell their stories through intentional and lasting design.

Recently, I’ve started my journey into software engineering, learning both frontend and backend development. I'm excited to grow, build, and one day bring my design and tech skills together to solve real-world problems.

Let’s connect and create something magical!✨
